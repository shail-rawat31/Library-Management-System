Library Management System
A Python-based mini project following Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Introduction
The Library Management System is a simple application designed to manage books and members within a library.
It helps in automating common tasks such as adding books, registering members, borrowing books, returning books, and generating basic reports.
The project focuses on clarity, simplicity, and practical use of core Python concepts.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide a basic digital system for libraries that:

Keeps track of books and members

Records borrowing and returning of books

Saves and retrieves information automatically

Demonstrates the use of classes, objects, and file handling in Python

Project Structure
The system consists of four main components:

1. Book Module
Represents each book in the library.
It stores details such as the title, author, ISBN number, availability status, and how many times the book has been borrowed.

2. Member Module
Represents a library member.
It stores the member’s personal details along with the list of books currently borrowed by them.

3. Library Module
Acts as the central controller for the entire system.
It manages:

Adding books

Registering members

Searching for books and members

Borrowing and returning books

Maintaining records

Displaying reports

Storing all information in easily readable files

4. Main Program
Provides the simple menu interface.
Through this interface, users can choose actions such as adding books, borrowing books, viewing reports, and exiting the system.

Key Features
Book Management
Add new books to the library

Track whether a book is available or borrowed

Maintain a count of how many times each book has been borrowed

Member Management
Register new library members

Keep record of the books each member has borrowed

Allow members to return books

Borrowing System
Borrow books using member ID and book ISBN

Prevent borrowing of already-borrowed books

Update library records after each transaction

Reporting System
Display total number of books

Display total number of members

Show how many books are currently borrowed

Identify the most frequently borrowed book

Data Storage
All data is stored in separate JSON files.
This ensures that information does not disappear even when the program is closed.
The files act like a simple database storing book and member details permanently.

Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, students learn:

How to design and organize a Python project

How to implement Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

How to work with classes, objects, methods, and attributes

How to store and retrieve information using external files

How to build menu-driven programs

How to structure real-world systems using programming logic

Conclusion
The Library Management System provides a clear example of how programming can support daily tasks in real environments.
It demonstrates the practical use of Object-Oriented Programming, modular code design, and basic data handling techniques in Python.
The project is simple enough for beginners but structured well enough to show how a real system works behind the scenes.

If you want, I can also prepare:
